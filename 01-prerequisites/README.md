# Prerequisites

This folder is for anyone who’s **new to Kubernetes** and might feel overwhelmed by all the tools and concepts.  
The idea is simple → **Learn only what you need, when you need it**.

---

## What’s Inside?

- **01-getting-started.md** → Absolute basics to get you running (Linux, Docker, YAML)  
- **02-learn-along-the-way.md** → Slightly deeper concepts you’ll naturally need as you progress  
- **03-advanced.md** → Optional stuff for when you’re comfortable and want to explore more

---

## Why This Exists?

Because most Kubernetes guides throw 100 things at you on day one.  
Here, we keep it **minimal → progressive → optional**.
