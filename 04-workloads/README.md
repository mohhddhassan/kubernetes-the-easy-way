# Workloads

Workloads in Kubernetes are the objects you use to run and manage your applications.

The most common workloads are:
- **Pod** â†’ Smallest unit in Kubernetes. Runs one or more containers.
- **ReplicaSet** â†’ Ensures a specified number of identical Pods are running.
- **Deployment** â†’ Manages ReplicaSets, provides updates, rollbacks, and scaling.

In this folder, youâ€™ll find examples for each workload type with simple YAML manifests.
