# 🌊 Kubernetes Learning Repo

This repo is my personal learning path for Kubernetes – from basics to some advanced topics.  
I’ve structured it in a way that I (and anyone else reading) can go step by step without getting lost 🚦.  

---

## 📂 Repo Structure

- **01-prerequisites**  
  → Things to know before touching Kubernetes (like Docker, YAML basics, etc).

- **02-k8s-basics**  
  → Core components of Kubernetes, how pods, services, deployments work.

- **03-cluster-setup**  
  → Setting up a cluster (minikube, kubeadm basics, configs).  
  → Also includes kubectl commands cheatsheet type notes.

- **04-workloads**  
  → Working with Deployments, ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, StatefulSets – running actual workloads.

- **05-advanced**  
  → Config & Secrets Management  
  → Networking Deep Dive  
  → Storage in Kubernetes  
  → Security  
  → Monitoring & Logging  
  → Helm basics (optional)  
  → Scaling & Autoscaling  

- **doubts**  
  → A space where I drop my doubts/questions while learning.  
  → Plan is that others (or future me) can check and maybe answer them.  
  → No question is “too small/dumb” – if I thought about it, it’s worth noting down here 👀.

## 🎯 Goal
- Make Kubernetes concepts simple and hands-on.  
- Have a single place where I can revise quickly.  
- Keep track of my learning progress + doubts.

## ⚡ Note
- Repo is still growing – I’ll add/update content as I explore more.  
- If you’re learning too, feel free to fork/clone and drop your own notes.
