# Kubernetes - The Easy Way

A beginner-friendly guide to learning Kubernetes **the easy way** – with practical notes, common doubts, and clear explanations from my own learning journey.  
This repo is designed for beginners who often get stuck with the same questions I had when I started.

---

## Why this repo?
When I started learning Kubernetes, I noticed:
- Official docs are detailed but overwhelming for beginners.
- Many video tutorials (like Tech With Nana) explain concepts well, but I still had follow-up doubts.
- I wanted one place where I could write **simple notes**, **questions**, and **answers** as I learn.

This repo is my way of documenting:
- What I learn every day.
- The doubts I face and how I solve them.
- Resources that actually helped me understand things faster.
